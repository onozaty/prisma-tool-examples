# prisma-tool-examples

Example project demonstrating Prisma v5, v6, and v7 implementations with automated schema management tools.

This repository showcases the usage of [prisma-schema-fixer](https://github.com/onozaty/prisma-schema-fixer) for enforcing naming conventions and [prisma-db-comments-generator](https://github.com/onozaty/prisma-db-comments-generator) for generating database comments from schema documentation.

Each version includes a simple e-commerce domain model (Customer, Product, Sale) to demonstrate these tools in action.
